doc-central (1.8.2+nmu3) unstable; urgency=low

  Due to FHS compliance policy, this package neither creates, nor
  installs any content in '/var/www/dc/'. Instead, the source content
  of previous packages, only two html-files, are now deposited in
  '/usr/share/doc-central/www/'. Observe that the old directory
  '/var/www/dc/' from previous versions of Doc-central, will be
  removed upon upgrade.
  
  The file README.Debian mentions ways of retaining the old
  functionality without interruption. An Apache2 alias definition
  is dropped into place by this package release.
