doc-central (1.8.2+nmu2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload to fix bugs related to processing of the
    Programming/C++ doc-base section (closes: #502556):
    - browse.cgi: handle section names that contain regex metacharacters;
    - docutils.py: properly encode URLs generated by makesectionlink().

doc-central (1.8.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "How can people still use that?" Release
  * Drop support for /usr/doc and /usr/info, so we can remove some
    broken regular expressions that prevented some docs from being
    viewed, and as it's high time we did that, anyway

  * doccentral.1:
    - updated maintainer e-mail address
    - fixed typo in environment variable name

  * README:
    - updated maintainer e-mail address

  * debian/control:
    - updated maintainer e-mail address
    - bumped standards-version to 3.6.2.1
    - dropped versioned dependency on python

  * debian/copyright:
    - updated

  * debian/doc-central.{install,manpages}:
    - created; moved things from debian/rules

  * debian/rules:
    - cleaned up

doc-central (1.8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Naming Releases is Fun" Release
  * Removed call to printerror function, which was removed together
    with cgiutils.py, and which cannot be implemented with the current
    doc-central design (Closes: #296947)

 -- Guilherme de S. Pastore <gpastore@colband.com.br>  Fri, 25 Feb 2005 23:04:58 -0300

doc-central (1.8) unstable; urgency=high

  * Two names release:
    - The "How Could I Be So Dumb?" Release
    - The "Really Old Bugs Can Be Fixed" Release
  * Set priority to optional (when was it set to extra?)
  * Fixed processing of dirs in order not to show only one document
    per section (higher urgency)
  * Parsing doc-base files which don't provide a full path for the
    index of documentation in info format no longer breaks makedoclink
    (Closes: #62219)
  * Removed cgiutils.py, which hasn't been used for some time now and
    has been forgotten around (Closes: #294742)

 -- Guilherme de S. Pastore <gpastore@colband.com.br>  Fri, 11 Feb 2005 14:57:25 -0200

doc-central (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made parsing of doc-base directory not fail if there's a
    subdirectory under it. There should NEVER be one, but some
    Debian-based distributions do it, and doc-central should not
    break because of it (Closes: #290846)
  * Fixed changelog (apache is definetely not a web browser, heh)

 -- Guilherme de S. Pastore <gpastore@colband.com.br>  Fri, 21 Jan 2005 23:07:59 -0200

doc-central (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Search now checks document name too (not only document title)
  * The doccentral wrapper now accepts a document name as a parameter,
    using viewdoc.cgi to put the left menu and search.cgi together to
    display the available findings (Closes: #284687, #285013)
  * Made the browsing of other files of the "see also" section (not only
    README and README.Debian) easier. This includes, but is not limited to
    changelogs, NEWS files and their gzipped versions
  * Fixed a regular expression in docutils.py in order not to hide
    documentation in info format with dots in the name. I can't really
    see a reason for this (Closes: #182555)
  * Make package name lowercase before looking for extra links, since
    there are packages (such as imagemagick) which register AlTerNateCaSe
    doc-base entries
  * debian/control:
    - Replaced Build-Depends with Build-Depends-Indep
    - Added apache as alternative for virtual dependancy on httpd
    - Added w3m as alternative for virtual recommendation on www-browser
  * debian/rules:
    - Now installs doccentral.1 (how could I forget that?)
    - Removed 'for' loops: install handles wildcards just perfectly
  * TODO:
    - Absurdly outdated: removed

doc-central (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (Closes: #282198)
  * Updated Standards-Version to 3.6.1.1
  * Created a menu entry for doccentral (Closes: #110550)
  * Added convenient way to access README and README.Debian if they are
    present and if the package has a doc-base entry (Closes: #147567)
  * doccentral:
    - Removed all the browser detection stuff: sensible-browser handles
      this in a far better way (Closes: #162523)
    - Added support for the DC_HOST environment variable, used to
      override Doc-Central's location (Closes: #269224)
  * doccentral.1:
    - General revision
    - Fixed grammar and spelling mistakes
    - Added reference to the DC_HOST environment variable
  * README:
    - Completely rewritten
    - Replaced '/usr/doc' with '/usr/share/doc' (Closes: #137374)
  * html/main.html:
    - Rewrote some chunks, corrected some mistakes and typos
    - Made a little more friendly :-)
  * maintainer scripts:
    - Dropped postinst, since it was only used to do the
      /usr/doc -> /usr/share/doc symlink "trick", and that was only needed
      until the release of Woody
    - Left prerm there for the cleanups
  * debian/rules:
    - Moved to CDBS
      + Added necessary build-dependencies to debian/control
    - Moved build dir to debian/doc-central
    - No need to remove *.pyc on clean, since we no longer byte-compile
      the scripts
  * Smaller cosmetic changes

 -- Guilherme de S. Pastore <gpastore@colband.com.br>  Fri, 26 Nov 2004 18:10:38 -0200
