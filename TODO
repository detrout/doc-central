TODO-list as of April 9, 2000:
* the current generated html-pages are ugly. I'm not a html-expert
  so any help in this area is appreciated. Please don't tell me
  "use a table" or so, but give me complete html-files which show
  what you would like to see. Or patches to the source of course!
* it uses doc-base registrations for documentation. This means that
  unless maintainers register the documents for their pacakges
  doc-central won't know about them. So please check your packages to
  see if you register all the documentation.
* It seems people don't agree on what documentation sections to use;
  we'll probably need to set some (policy) guidelines.
* I can add customizations (the basic framework to handle cgi parameters
  and cookies is already in place). However since I'm already reasonably
  happy with the way it works any suggestions are welcomed.
