Welcome to Doc-Central!

Doc-Central is a collection of scripts that give you a convenient way
to browse the documentation installed on your Debian system. 

Quick start: run "doccentral" or point your webbrowser to
http://localhost/dc/ .

Doc-Central uses a local http server (like apache) to present a list of
all registered documents. Depending on the type of document other tools
are used to view the document: for info files we use info2www.  All
other types are currently linked to directly. To get the list of installed
documentation the doc-base registration entries as used. For more
information on doc-base please install the doc-base package and read
the documentation in /usr/doc/doc-base.

Please note that by default other people can also view the documentation
on your system. Some people consider this a security risk since it gives
others an idea on what software you installed. If you don't want to
allow others to view the documentation on your system you will need to
configure your http server to restrict access.

If you use a browser that is capable of handling forms you will see an
index of documentation sections on the left side. By selecting a section
you will be presented with a list of available documents in that
section. Simply clicking on the title of a document will show the
document for you. Some documents will be available in multiple formats;
if so a list of formats will be given next to the title. Clicking on a
format will show you the document in that format.
