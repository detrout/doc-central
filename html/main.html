<h2>Welcome to Doc-Central</h2>

<p>Doc-Central is a tool to conveniently browse the documentation available
on your Debian system.</p>

<p>Please, select a category of your interest on the list located on
the left side. Once you do that, a list of documents in that category
will be shown. Also, if you have a clear idea of what you are looking
for, you can look for your specific needs by entering a regular expression
and clicking on the 'search' button. If you enter an invalid regular
expression, a normal string search will be used instead.</p>

<p>You can view a document by selecting its title. In case it is available
in more than one format, all the possibilities will be listed next to the
title. Simply choose the format of your choice and it will get displayed.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
