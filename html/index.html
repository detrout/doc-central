<h1>Welcome to Doc-Central</h1>

<p>Doc-Central is a tool to conveniently browse the documentation on your
Debian system.</p>

<p>It looks like you are using a browser that does not handle frames
properly. This is not a problem, but please note it makes browsing the
documentation a bit more inconvenient.</p>

<p>If you click <a href="/cgi-bin/doc-central/contents.cgi">here</a>,
you will get a list of available sections. By selecting a section list
of documents in that section will show up. You can also search the list
of documents by entering a regular expression and clicking on the 'search'
button. If you enter an invalid regular expression, a normal string search
will be used instead.</p>

<p>You can view the documentation by selecting its title.  If it is
available in multiple formats the formats will be listed next to the
title. Simply selecting the format of your choice will show the
document in desired format.</p>
